    "With our current EM algorithm implementation, we can see this reflected in the number of clusters chosen either via AIC or BIC. AIC consistently chooses more clusters than BIC through multiple runs. Due to brands having different models of cars, we will see brands repeated throughout the clusters. We can still extrapolate information from the groupings (are perceived high-end brands grouped together? etc...)\n",

    "Interestingly, even with a high colinearilty shown through the high R squared value, not many of the chosen parameters are statistically significant. If we take a look at the chassis specifications, the length and height are statistically significant while the width is not. Additionally, only battery capacity, number of cells in the battery, the range of the car, and towing capacity in kilograms can help predict the efficiency of the car.\n",

    "With technical specs such as the size of the chassis, battery capacity, number of cells, etc... most seem to be statistically significant (p-value less than 0.05). The only two features that do not hold as much statistical significance are the top speed of the car and the fast charging capacity. Overall with a high R squared value, the linear regression model performs really well with estimating the range of the cars measured in kilometers. If customers are looking at the market in the future and are looking for high performing, efficient EVs, predictive analysis seems to be very performant."
