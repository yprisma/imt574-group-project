If we take a look at the chassis specifications, the length and height are statistically significant while the width is not. Additionally, only battery capacity, number of cells in the battery, the range of the car, and towing capacity in kilograms can help predict the efficiency of the car.\n",

The only two features that do not hold as much statistical significance are the top speed of the car and the fast charging capacity. Overall with a high R squared value, the linear regression model performs really well with estimating the range of the cars measured in kilometers. If customers are looking at the market in the future and are looking for high performing, efficient EVs, predictive analysis seems to be very performant."
